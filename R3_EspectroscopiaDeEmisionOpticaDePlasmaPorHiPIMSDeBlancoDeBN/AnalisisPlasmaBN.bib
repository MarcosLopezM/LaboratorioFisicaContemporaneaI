  abstract = {The work presented in this thesis involves experimental and
              theoretical studies related to a thin film deposition technique
              called high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS), and more
              specifically the plasma properties and how they influence the
              coating. HiPIMS is an ionized physical vapor deposition technique
              based on conventional direct current magnetron sputtering (DCMS).
              The major difference between the two methods is that HiPIMS has the
              added advantage of providing substantial ionization of the
              sputtered material, and thus presents many new opportunities for
              the coating industry. Understanding the dynamics of the charged
              species and their effect on thin film growth in the HiPIMS process
              is therefore essential for producing high-quality coatings. In the
              first part of the thesis a new type of anomalous electron transport
              was found. Investigations of the transport resulted in the
              discovery that this phenomenon could quantitatively be described as
              being related and mediated by highly nonlinear waves, likely due to
              the modified two-stream instability, resulting in electric field
              oscillations in the MHz-range (the lower hybrid frequency).
              Measurements in the plasma confirmed these oscillations as well as
              trends predicted by the theory of these types of waves. Using
              electric probes, the degree of anomalous transport in the plasma
              could also be determined by measuring the current density ratio
              between the azimuthal current density (of which the Hall current
              density is one contribution) and the discharge current density, Jϕ
              / JD. The results were verified in another series of measurements
              using Rogowski probes to directly gain insight into the internal
              currents in the HiPIMS discharge. The results provided important
              insights into understanding the mechanism behind the anomalous
              transport. It was furthermore demonstrated that the current ratio
              Jϕ / JD is inversely proportional to the transverse resistivity, η⊥
              , which governs how well momentum in the direction of the current
              is transferred from the electrons to the ions in the plasma. By
              looking at the forces involved in the charged particle transport it
              was expected that the azimuthally rotating electrons would exert a
              volume force on the ions tangentially outwards from the circular
              race track region. The effect of having an anomalous transport
              would therefore be that the ions were transported across the
              magnetic field lines and to a larger extent deflected sideways,
              instead of solely moving from the target region towards a substrate
              placed in front of the target some distance away. From the
              experiments it was confirmed that a substantial fraction of
              sputtered material is transported radially away from the cathode
              and lost to the walls in HiPIMS as well as in DCMS, but more so for
              HiPIMS giving one possible explanation to why the deposition rate
              is lower for HiPIMS compared to DCMS. Moreover, in a separate
              investigation on the energy flux it could be determined that the
              heating due to radial energy flux reached as much as 60 \% of the
              axial energy flux, which is likely a result of the anomalous
              transport of charged species present in the HiPIMS discharge. Also,
              the recorded ion energy flux confirmed theoretical estimations on
              this type of transport regarding energy and direction.In order to
              gain a better understanding of the complete discharge regime, as
              well as providing a link between the HiPIMS and DCMS processes, the
              current and voltage characteristics were investigated for discharge
              pulses longer than 100 μs. The current behavior was found to be
              strongly correlated with the chamber gas pressure. Based on these
              experiments it was suggested that high-current transients commonly
              seen in the HiPIMS process cause a depletion of the working gas in
              the area in front of the target, and thereby a transition to a
              DCMS-like high voltage, lower current regime, which alters the
              deposition conditions. In the second part of the thesis, using the
              results and ideas from the fundamental plasma investigations, it
              was possible to successfully implement different coating
              improvements. First, the concept of sideways deposition of thin
              films was examined in a dual-magnetron system providing a solution
              for coating complex shaped surfaces. Here, the two magnetrons were
              facing each other having opposing magnetic fields forcing electrons
              , and thereby also ionized material to be transported radially
              towards the substrate. In this way deposition inside tubular
              substrates can be made in a beneficial way. Last, the densification
              process of thin films using HiPIMS was investigated for eight
              different materials (Al, Ti, Cr, Cu, Zr, Ag, Ta, and Pt). Through
              careful characterization of the thin film properties it was
              determined that the HiPIMS coatings were approximately 5-15 \%
              denser compared to the DCMS coatings. This could be attributed to
              the increased ion bombardment seen in the HiPIMS process, where the
              momentum transfer between the growing film and the incoming ions is
              very efficient due to the equal mass of the atoms constituting the
              film and the bombarding species, leading to a less pronounced
              columnar microstructure. The deposition conditions were also
              examined using a global plasma model, which was in good agreement
              with the experimental results.},
